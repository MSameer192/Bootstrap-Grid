              I received a job offer mid-course,
              and the subjects I learned were current, if not more so, in the
              company I joined. I honestly feel I got every penny’s worth.

              “ I was
              an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I’ve been
              looking to make a transition and have heard some people who had an
              amazing experience here. I signed up for the free intro course and
              found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12
              weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since
              completing the course, I’ve successfully switched careers, working
              as a Software Engineer at a VR startup. ”
